### Is your task related to a problem? Please describe
The GitHub Workflow has been unable to update Che-Code with the latest VS Code patches and needs human attention.
[The Workflow](https://github.com/che-incubator/che-code/actions/workflows/rebase-insiders.yml) has been disabled.

### Describe the solution you'd like
1. See the output of [the latest failed job](https://github.com/che-incubator/che-code/actions/workflows/rebase-insiders.yml) to analyze the conflicting files.
